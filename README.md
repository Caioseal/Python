<h1>Python</h1>

Here you will find basic exercises that I have learned watching YouTube videos in portuguese about:
- Strings
- Boolean
- Operators
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- if & else
- While loops
- For loops
- Functions
- Arrays

Note: All variables names and functions are in portuguese.
